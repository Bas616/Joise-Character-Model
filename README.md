# Project: "Joise" - Custom Character Model

## Overview

This repository contains a customized 3D character model named "Joise". The project started with a base model and involved significant modifications, including the addition of custom-designed accessories like glasses and new clothing textures, to create a unique character.

This project serves as a personal exercise in 3D modeling, sculpting, and asset modification using tools like Nomad Sculpt.
